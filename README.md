# Marshmallow

Marshmallow is a Markdown-esque plain text file format that combines [CampfireJS](https://www.github.com/lawsonry/campfirejs) and HTML to create dynamic web pages. 

Marshmallow is the system used to compile *.mm files into *.html files. It is sometimes called "Marshmallow Markdown." 

## Syntax

If you know Markdown, you know 90% of Marshmallow. The largest differences come in the way Marshmallow interacts with JavaScript. 

### The index.html file

Marshmallow creates static pages by processing *.mm files according to the rules specified in Marshmallow.json file in your site's root.
